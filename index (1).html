           <div id="about">
            Puppies as young as 4 or 5 weeks old were roaming alone through the streets, feeding off food scraps, cardboard and plastic bags, trying to survive the bustling roads and blistering heat - desperately clinging to every inch of life. I saw dogs who were wounded, blind, missing limbs and bleeding from open lacerations. Many dogs had lost the will to survive and were left to decay on the roadside.<br>
            Garbage and lack of animal birth control are the leading factors contributing to the increase of stray dogs. The streets of India are littered with garbage, making them the ideal breeding ground for stray dogs who have not been spayed or neutered. India's street dogs are natural born scavengers, living almost entirely off the garbage created by humans. In Mumbai alone, at least 500 tons of garbage are left uncollected every single day. This leaves many street dogs vulnerable to choking to death on plastic or eating something indigestible, which could cause a slow and painful death.
            
            <br><br>Our vision is to make a great life for every street dog by providing the shelter in our NGO for dogs. <br>We want to spread the message of love, 
            peace, and harmony for the welfare of dogs among the animal lovers.

        Animals may be mute but we as a society have to speak on their behalf. No pain or agony should be caused to the animals. 
        <br>
        Cruelty to animals causes psychological pain to them. Animals breathe like us and have emotions. 
        <br>
        The animals require food, water, shelter, safety, normal behavior and self-determination.
